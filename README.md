# Taurus Project

Taurus Project is a target shooter that originally made as a tech demo for 3D2sprite to demonstrate what can be achieved with sprites exported from the software. Note, due to large size of the images the loading time of the game may be not optimal.

Features:

    spawn enemies every x second
    enemies move toward the player 
    can shoot only the closest enemies
    ammo is limited, need to reload once we have no more bullet
    once an enemy get close enough to the player, it hit the player and game over

Source code is available for the following engines:

    GDevelop 5

NOTE: Images, Sounds and Fonts included for demonstration purposes only, no commercial use allowed. The actual project file is free to use for any purposes
